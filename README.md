# Blocmetrics
===========

There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean I can't build a one myself! This analytics service will offer a few key features:

* A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.
* A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.
* A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.

## Features:

#### Users:
1. Sign up for a free account by providing a name, password, and email.
2. Can sign in and out of **Blocmetrics**.
3. May register an application with **Blocmetrics** for tracking.
4. Can view events associated with registered applications.
5. Use JavaScript to capture client-side events in my application
6. Can see a graph of events for each registered application.

#### Developers:
1. Receive incoming events in an API controller.
